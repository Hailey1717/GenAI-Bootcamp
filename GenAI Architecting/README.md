## Functional Requirements

We need a high-performing GPU cluster that can handle intense data processing and high traffic.
We also need to ensure we prioritise data privacy and compliance.
Since we are targeting users who mainly want to learn Kenyan Swahili dialect, we must provide accurate data to students. The AI model must be well-versed with Kenyan Swahili to avoid any confusion as we also have Tanzanian Swahili which is quite different e.g in sentence construction, verbs.

## Assumptions

We assume that the LLM we choose will differentiate between the Tanzanian and Kenyan dialect.
